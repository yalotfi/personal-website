# personal-website
Development of my own website will function as a dynamic resume.  It should showcase projects and interests that go beyond a basic resume.

This is the "dabbles in web development" portion of my GitHub account description.  I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the side so work ebbs and flows.  I'm actually really enjoying these languages since they're a good change of pace from the data science/GIS workflow.

Everything on the site is fairly basic, but I want to stick to Bootstrap's mobile-first framework.  This side project will also serve as a test bench, if you will, to dive into more advanced coding as I get into the back-end workings of web-development.  Who knows, maybe PHP is in my future.
